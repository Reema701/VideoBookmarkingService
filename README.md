# VideoBookmarkingService
A solution made in PHP and HTML5 for user to bookmark &amp; organize videos of interest to watch later on any platform. It lets you pause on one device and resume on another.

# How to use
First create a "vid" folder at the same level (as css, js etc.).
Fill it with sample mp4 files (they were too large to upload, so couldnt)
Name them : AdobePhotoshopTouch.mp4, AdobePrimetimeOverview.mp4 , Lightroom.mp4, PhotoshopCC.mp4, PhotoshopLive.mp4, Primetime.mp4
(These are used in the project overall, if you use different files with different names, remember to replace them in the whole project.)

1. Host the solution on a webserver like any other project (should have php enabled).
2. Index page lists out all videos that user can use.
3. Play back a certain video and click on submit bookmark.
4. Stop the application, and open from another device.
5. play the same video on that device (say a mobile this time).
6. It will play back from the bookmarked location.
